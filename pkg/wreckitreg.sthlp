{pstd}
 {cmd:wreckitreg} solves for a scale factor on either the dependent variable or one of the independent variables ({cmd:coefvar()}) such that the coefficient value of a specified independent variable {cmd:coefvar()} or the semi-elasticity estimate with respect to {cmd:coefvar()} evaluated at the means of covariates is a certain value in a regression with log(+1) or ihs() transformation.
 By default, the value is obtained for the semi-elasticity estimate unless {bf:coefficient} is specified.
 The command reports the scale factor needed to scale {bf:depvar} or {bf:coefvar} by to yield a coefficient or semi-elasticity estimate on {bf:coefvar()} of {bf:value()}.
 The scaling factor is limited by machine precision, therefore a reasonable achievable range is also outputted.
 The scaling factor is restricted to be positive.
 The theoretical limits of the coefficient and semi-elasticity estimates when the scaling factor approaches 0 or infinity are computed.
 The coefficient and semi-elasticity estimates may not change monotonically with the scale, so values outside the theoretical limits can still be achieved.

{phang}
{opt coefvar(varname)} independent variable whose coefficient or semi-elasticity is to be achieved. If there is only one independent variable listed, then {bf:coefvar} can be omitted and will take the value of the independent variable. {bf:coefvar} is required if more than one independent variable is specified in {help indepvars}.

{phang}
{opt value} desired coefficient or semi-elasticity value of {cmd:coefvar}

{phang}
{opt coefficient} obtain coefficient {bf:value} instead of semi-elasticity {bf:value} (evaluated at the means of covariates) for {bf:coefvar}

{phang}
{opt ihs} use inverse hyperbolic sine function for transformation; default is to use log(+1) transformation

{phang}
{opt transform_x} transform {bf:coefvar}; default is to transform the dependent variable
